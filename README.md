# Libft ðŸ“š

This is the first project of the 42cursus.

### Objectives
  * Recode some functions from the standard C library.
  * Code other functions for the manipulation of strings, integers, linked lists... (Allowed functions : write, malloc, free)
  * Create a Makefile that compiles them and put it in an archive.

### What I've learnt from this project
  * Basics of C programming.
  * Manipulation of data structures (Linked lists for the bonus part).
  * Creation of a static library.
  * Creation of a Makefile to automate compilation.
  * A little bit of problem solving.
  * Unix logic.

### Final grade
125/100.

### How to use the library
 1. Include the header file 'libft.h' in your main file.
 2. Type 'make' in the terminal for the compilation process. ('make' for the mandatory part, 'make bonus' for the bonus part (linked list functions))
 3. Compile your main file with the archive 'libft.a'.
